csv_compare_redis - A CSV Comparison Tool using Redis
=====================================================

compare two csv files using an identity column to locate missing rows, 
duplicates, and data mismatches using a Redis server


Usage
=====

$ ./csv_compare file1.txt file2.txt identity_column

This is a Python 2 script.  You may need to change the shebang line
#!/usr/bin/env python2
to your Python 2 interpreter

Or simply run the script with the interpreter
$ python2 ./csv_compare file1.txt file2.txt identity_column
or
$ python ./csv_compare file1.txt file2.txt identity_column

For complete usage instructions, see
$ python ./csv_compare --help


Redis
=====

This tool is to be used with a Redis server instance


Memory Usage
============

Because Redis loads the entire data set into memory, you must have enough
RAM + SWAP to hold at least the size of the two files combined, plus some
additional space for overhead.


Output
======
Duplicate IDs and missing row information is output to stderr. Rows with
mismatched data are written side by side in csv format to stdout.
