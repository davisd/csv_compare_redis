csv_compare_redis - A CSV Comparison Tool using Redis
=====================================================

compare two csv files using an identity column to locate missing rows, 
duplicates, and data mismatches using a Redis server


Usage
=====

$ ./csv_compare file1.txt file2.txt identity_column

This is a Python 2 script.  You may need to change the shebang line
#!/usr/bin/env python2
to your Python 2 interpreter

Or simply run the script with the interpreter
$ python2 ./csv_compare file1.txt file2.txt identity_column
or
$ python ./csv_compare file1.txt file2.txt identity_column

For complete usage instructions, see
$ python ./csv_compare --help


Redis
=====

This tool is to be used with a Redis server instance.

The python libraries used are:

redis-py https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py
and
hiredis-py - https://github.com/pietern/hiredis-py

Using hiredis apparently speeds queries up to 10x from the redis-py default.


Memory Usage
============

Because Redis loads the entire data set into memory, you must have enough
RAM + SWAP to hold at least the size of the two files combined, plus some
additional space for overhead.

To disable Redis persistence (disk saves), start Redis with all of the
"save" lines commented out in the Redis configuration file.


Output
======
Duplicate IDs and missing row information is output to stderr. Rows with
mismatched data are written side by side in csv format to stdout.
